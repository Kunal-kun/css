            <p> A club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
                So the bar is where I go (Mm)<br>
                Me and my friends at the table doin' shots<br>
                Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)<br>
                And you come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
                And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)<br>
                Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
                And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like<br>
                
                [Chorus]
                Girl, you know I want your love<br>
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"<br>
                Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
                Well, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm<br>
                
                [Chorus]
                I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
                Although my heart is fallin' too<br>
                I'm in love with your body<br>
                And last night, you were in my room<br>
                And now my bed sheets smell like you<br>
                Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new<br>
                Well, I'm in love with your body<br>
